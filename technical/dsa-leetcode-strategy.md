# DSA & LeetCode strategy


## why DSA matters

Every major tech company tests data structures and algorithms in their interviews. Whether it's FAANG, startups, or mid-size companies, you **will** be asked to solve coding problems on a whiteboard or in a shared editor.

- The good news: there are only ~15 core patterns that cover 90%+ of interview questions
- The bad news: you can't cram this in a weekend; it takes consistent practice
- The strategy below gives you a structured path from zero to interview-ready

> [!tip]
> **Quick Tip:** Don't grind 500 random problems. Focus on **patterns** first, then apply them across problems. Quality over quantity.

---

# the strategy: how to actually study

## step 1: learn the pattern, not just the problem

Every problem below belongs to a **pattern category**. Before solving problems, understand the pattern:

1. **Watch the video solution** first to understand the approach
2. **Code it yourself** without looking; struggle is where learning happens
3. **If stuck for 20+ minutes**, re-watch the video and try again
4. **Review your solution**: can you explain it out loud?

## step 2: follow the roadmap in order

The problems below are organized from **Foundation to Expert**. Each level builds on the previous one. Don't skip ahead; the patterns compound.

## step 3: track your progress

Track which problems you've completed and compete with others using the practice link above.

> [!warning]
> **Important:** Aim for **2-3 problems per day** consistently rather than 20 problems in one day. Spaced repetition is how you retain patterns.

---

# foundation level

These are your building blocks. Master these before moving on; nearly every harder problem uses these patterns.

## arrays + hashing

> Foundation for most problems: efficient lookups and storage.

**Core idea:** Use hash maps for O(1) lookups instead of brute-force nested loops. If you're writing two nested for-loops, there's almost always a hash map solution.

**Strategy:**
- Always ask: "Can I trade space for time with a hash map?"
- For frequency problems, use a counter/dictionary
- For "find pair" problems, store complements in a set

| 8 | Maximum Subarray Sum | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WZl3MMT0Eg) |

---

## two pointers

> Builds on arrays to solve search and pairing problems.

**Core idea:** Use two pointers moving toward each other (or in the same direction) to reduce O(n^2) to O(n). Works best on **sorted arrays**.

**Strategy:**
- Sort the array first if not already sorted
- Left pointer starts at beginning, right at end
- Move the pointer that gets you closer to your target

| 7 | Trapping Rain Water | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI2z5pq0TqA) |

---

## stack

> Adds memory of previous elements: great for parsing and monotonic problems.

**Core idea:** Use a stack when you need to remember previous elements and process them in reverse order (LIFO). If you see nested structures or "next greater/smaller" patterns, think stack.

**Strategy:**
- Matching brackets/parentheses = stack
- "Next greater element" = monotonic stack
- Evaluate expressions = stack with operators

| 6 | Largest Rectangle in Histogram | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx5Sw9130L0) |

---

## binary search

> Builds on arrays for sorted search optimization.

**Core idea:** If the input is sorted (or has a monotonic property), you can eliminate half the search space each step. O(log n) instead of O(n).

**Strategy:**
- Classic binary search: find target in sorted array
- "Minimum/maximum that satisfies condition" = binary search on answer
- Always check: can I binary search the search space?

| 5 | Median of Two Sorted Arrays | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6IEA26hvXc) |

---

## sliding window

> Extends array logic for subarray optimization.

**Core idea:** Maintain a "window" over a contiguous subarray/substring. Expand the right side, shrink the left side when constraints are violated. Turns O(n^2) substring problems into O(n).

**Strategy:**
- "Longest/shortest substring with condition" = sliding window
- Use a hash map to track window contents
- Expand right pointer, shrink left when window is invalid

| 5 | Sliding Window Maximum | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfljaUwZsOk) |

---

# intermediate level

Linked & hierarchical structures. These build on your foundation patterns and introduce pointer manipulation and recursion.

## linked list

**Core idea:** Pointer manipulation. Most linked list problems are about rewiring `.next` pointers. Draw it out on paper first.

**Strategy:**
- Use a **dummy node** to simplify edge cases (empty list, single node)
- **Fast and slow pointers** detect cycles and find midpoints
- Reverse a linked list is a building block for many harder problems

| 5 | Add Two Numbers | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgFPrzTjm7s) |

---

## trees

**Core idea:** Most tree problems are solved with **DFS** (recursive) or **BFS** (level-order with a queue). The recursive structure of trees maps naturally to recursive solutions.

**Strategy:**
- Ask: "Can I solve this with a recursive DFS?" - usually yes
- For level-by-level processing, use BFS with a queue
- BST property: left < root < right; use this for validation and search

| 7 | Kth Smallest Element in a BST | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LUXSvjmGCw) |

---

## tries

**Core idea:** A trie (prefix tree) stores strings character by character. Perfect for prefix matching, autocomplete, and word search problems.

**Strategy:**
- If the problem involves prefixes or dictionary lookups, think trie
- Each node has up to 26 children (for lowercase English)
- Mark end-of-word nodes to distinguish complete words from prefixes

| 4 | Word Search II | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6OGOZ2N5-w) |

---

# advanced patterns

Recursion & optimization. These patterns are harder but show up frequently in interviews at top companies.

## backtracking

**Core idea:** Build solutions incrementally and abandon ("backtrack") paths that can't lead to a valid solution. It's DFS on a decision tree.

**Strategy:**
- Draw the decision tree first
- At each step: make a choice, recurse, undo the choice
- Prune early: skip branches that violate constraints

| 5 | Sudoku Solver | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC1rbW2YSz0) |

---

## heap / priority queue

**Core idea:** Efficiently track the min/max element. Use a heap when you need repeated access to the smallest or largest item.

**Strategy:**
- "Top K" anything = heap
- Use a **min heap** of size K to find the Kth largest
- Use a **max heap** when you need the largest element quickly

| # | Problem | Video Solution |
|---|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Kth Largest Element in a Stream | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOjcdrqMoQ8) |

| 5 | Merge K Sorted Lists | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5a5OiGbT6Q) |

---

## graphs

**Core idea:** Model problems as nodes and edges. Most graph problems use BFS (shortest path) or DFS (exploration/connected components).

**Strategy:**
- "Number of islands" type = DFS/BFS flood fill
- "Shortest path" = BFS (unweighted) or Dijkstra (weighted)
- "Can I complete all tasks?" = topological sort (cycle detection)
- Always track visited nodes to avoid infinite loops

## dynamic programming (1-D)

**Core idea:** Break a problem into overlapping subproblems. Store results to avoid recomputation. If a recursive solution has repeated calls, DP can optimize it.

**Strategy:**
- Start with a **recursive** brute-force solution
- Add **memoization** (top-down) or build a **DP table** (bottom-up)
- Define your state clearly: `dp[i]` = what does index i represent?
- Find the **recurrence relation**: how does `dp[i]` relate to previous values?

| 4 | Partition Equal Subset Sum | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsvocB5BJhw) |

---

## dynamic programming (2-D)

**Core idea:** Same as 1-D DP but with two changing variables. `dp[i][j]` usually represents a subproblem on a substring, subarray, or grid.

**Strategy:**
- String comparison problems (edit distance, LCS) = 2D DP
- Grid traversal problems (unique paths) = 2D DP
- Draw out the DP table to visualize transitions

# expert level

Optimization & logic. These are the patterns that separate good from great in interviews.

## intervals

**Core idea:** Sort by start (or end) time, then process intervals linearly. Most interval problems become simple after sorting.

**Strategy:**
- Sort intervals by start time
- Compare current interval's start with previous interval's end
- Merge, insert, or count based on overlap

| 4 | Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9oS6pC0QNM) |

---

## greedy

**Core idea:** Make the locally optimal choice at each step. Greedy works when the local optimum leads to the global optimum.

**Strategy:**
- Ask: "Does choosing the best option right now hurt future choices?"
- If not, greedy works
- Often paired with sorting

| 4 | Hand of Straights | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amnrMCVd2YI) |

---

## advanced graphs

**Core idea:** Weighted graph algorithms. Dijkstra for shortest path, Prim's/Kruskal's for minimum spanning trees.

**Strategy:**
- "Shortest path with weights" = Dijkstra (use a min heap)
- "Connect all nodes with minimum cost" = MST (Prim's or Kruskal's)

| 2 | Min Cost to Connect All Points | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7JOBJIC-NA) |

---

## bit manipulation

**Core idea:** Use binary operations (AND, OR, XOR, shifts) for O(1) space tricks. XOR is especially powerful: `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`.

**Strategy:**
- "Find the single/missing number" = XOR everything
- Count bits with `n & (n - 1)` to clear lowest set bit
- Use bit shifts for powers of 2

| 5 | Reverse Integer | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAgLH58IgJQ) |

---

## math + geometry

**Core idea:** Matrix manipulation, number theory, and spatial reasoning. These problems test your ability to think mathematically.

**Strategy:**
- Matrix rotation: transpose + reverse rows
- Spiral traversal: track boundaries (top, bottom, left, right)
- For number problems, think about mathematical properties first

# interview day tips

> [!tip]
> **Success Strategy:** During the actual interview, follow this framework for every problem:

1. **Clarify** (1-2 min): Repeat the problem, ask about edge cases, confirm input/output
2. **Plan** (3-5 min): Identify the pattern, explain your approach, discuss time/space complexity
3. **Code** (15-20 min): Write clean code, talk through your logic as you go
4. **Test** (3-5 min): Walk through an example, check edge cases, fix bugs

> [!warning]
> **Important:** If you get stuck, **communicate**. Say "I'm thinking about using X pattern because..."; interviewers want to see your thought process, not just the answer.

### common mistakes in interviews

- Jumping straight into code without a plan
- Going silent when stuck
- Not testing your solution with examples
- Ignoring edge cases (empty input, single element, duplicates)
- Over-engineering when a simple solution works

### time complexity cheat sheet

| Complexity | Name | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| O(1) | Constant | Hash map lookup |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic | Binary search |
| O(n) | Linear | Single pass through array |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic | Sorting |
| O(n^2) | Quadratic | Nested loops (usually avoidable) |
| O(2^n) | Exponential | Brute-force subsets |
